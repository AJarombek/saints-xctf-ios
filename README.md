# saints-xctf-ios

The SaintsXCTF iOS App goes along with my website SaintsXCTF.com.  All development is done in Swift.  
The backend calls the REST API built on the website server (Written in PHP).

There is also an Android app that was released August 2017.

You can follow development of the website here: [SaintsXCTF Website GitHub](https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf).

You can follow development of the android app here: [SaintsXCTF Android GitHub](https://github.com/AJarombek/saints-xctf-android).
